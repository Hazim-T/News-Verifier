# Fake News Classifier

This project implements a simple **Fake News Classifier** using **TensorFlow** and **Natural 
Language Processing** techniques. The model predicts whether a given news article is "real" or "fake."

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and tokenize text data.
- **Deep Learning Model:** A CNN-based binary classifier with an embedding layer.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy and loss plots for training and validation.
- **Prediction:** Classify user-input text as "real" or "fake."
- **Visualization:** Word clouds for fake and real news datasets.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing labeled news articles (0 = real, 1 = fake).

The dataset was sourced from huggingface.
